I am building a AI hobby tracker with a mystical/magic style webapp using Vite + React + Hono + Cloudflare, Currently I have the template stuff imported and want to get started with the project. I want to replace the template filler with a very basic layout to get started.

We are probably going to want the following pages for our webapp, dashboard/home, hobbies, items, add, discover, activity, settings. Can you implement the basic templates of these pages?
