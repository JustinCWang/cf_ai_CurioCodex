I am building a AI hobby tracker with a mystical/magic style webapp using Vite + React + Hono + Cloudflare, Currently I have the template stuff imported and want to get started with the project. I want to replace the template filler with a very basic layout to get started.

We are probably going to want the following pages for our webapp, dashboard/home, hobbies, items, add, discover, activity, settings. Can you implement the basic templates of these pages?

Can you explain to me how wrangler works and what DB options Cloudflare offers in context of our app. Then walk me through what we need to do to create the login/register workflow.
